# {absmaps} is depreciated; use alternatives

This package is hard depreciated and will be removed from Github shortly. It is replaced by: 

1. `{absmapsdata}`: [contains compressed, tidied, and lazily-loadable sf objects that hold geometric information about ABS data structures.](https://github.com/wfmackey/absmapsdata). Install with: `remotes::install_github("wfmackey/absmapsdata")`.
2. `{strayr}`: [contains a helper function, `read_absmaps()`, to download `sf` objects from `{absmapsdata}` on demand.](https://github.com/runapp-aus/strayr). Install with: `remotes::install_github("runapp-aus/strayr")`.
